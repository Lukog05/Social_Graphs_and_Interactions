Steps to Run Section A: finalv2_aniList_scraper:
i) Run the 1st, 3rd and 4th 'CODE' blocks of the notebook.
ii) for reference, to download between top 100 and 200 the arguements are:
anime_data = fetch_anilist_top_entries(media_limit=100, page=3, max_characters=-1, max_staff=-1)
and from 1000 to 1100 they are:
anime_data = fetch_anilist_top_entries(media_limit=100, page=21, max_characters=-1, max_staff=-1)
